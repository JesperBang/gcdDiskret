# Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
## Releases
A compiled jar file can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/JesperBang/gcdDiskret/releases) or you can compile one yourself from the source code.

## Wiki
I wrote this software a while back to help myself under my discrete mathematics exam. Finding the greatest common divisor is not a hard task by it self but i wanted to spare time and make sure that i did not make misktes in the large amount of small simple calculations.

This is the source code, yes i know it is really bad and dirty, but it did the job i needed it to do and i do not want to spend time rewriting it now as i am done using it. Feel free to use this source code under MIT license and remember the software is releases as is.

On this image a demostration of the gcdBreaker software is showcased on an actualy GCD task along with teachers proposed solution.
